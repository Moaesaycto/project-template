# **Project Template**

**Type:** Web App Starter · **Tech Stack:** Vite, TypeScript, React · **Status:** Active

## **Overview**

**Project Template** is my custom Vite and TypeScript starter setup that I clone when beginning new web projects. It provides a ready-to-use foundation with consistent styling and structure. You can see this template [live](https://moaesaycto.github.io/project-template/).

## **Features**

* **Prebuilt Components:** Includes reusable UI elements and custom CSS for rapid prototyping.
* **Social Embedding:** Metadata configured for clean previews on Facebook, LinkedIn, Discord, and X/Twitter.
* **Developer Ready:** Optimised build settings and directory layout for fast setup and deployment.

## **Purpose**

Built to standardise my workflow and reduce setup time across new web projects.

## **Future Plans**

In the future, SEO optimisation will be automated on this, so any future projects can be cloned and immediatey eligible for indexing once they have been deployed.
